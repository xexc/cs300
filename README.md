What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
  The problem being solved in the project for this course was managing and processing course information in a computer science curriculum. The goal included reading data from files, organizing course data, handling prerequisites, and providing functionalities like searching and printing course information.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
  To approach the problem, I started by understanding the requirements and the data involved. This included analyzing the input file format, identifying the necessary operations to perform on the data (inserting, searching, removing), and determining appropriate data structures to represent and organize the information effectively. In this case, the use of a hash table data structure was mentioned.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
  To overcome roadblocks, it is important to break down the problem into smaller tasks, analyze the problem, seek help from documentation or peers, and apply debugging techniques. Debugging tools and techniques, such as printing intermediate results or using a debugger, can be valuable for identifying and resolving issues.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
  By providing experience in translating requirements into code, I can expand my approach to designing software and developing programs. It enhances problem-solving skills, encourages organized code design, and promotes the use of data structures and algorithms for efficient and maintainable solutions.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  In terms of writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs, working on projects allows for applying software engineering principles and best practices. This includes writing code with well-defined interfaces, using meaningful variable and function names, documenting the code and its behavior, and following coding conventions and style guidelines.
